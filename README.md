# Friending Me

## Description
When life gets crayz, it's very easy to sort of ignore your wellness, especially mental health since it is not visible. 

Friending Me is an app where you can take a break from drama and sit down with yourself. 

When users log in, they are able to make logs of their current feelings, and record their assets to self-motivate themselves! 

Watch your avatar grow as you record more things about you on Friending Me!

Make sure to bring your friend with you, yourself.
